Lightweight static site generator in PHP without a database

```
Version: 1.0.0
```

### History

When creating Swifost , my goal was to keep it simple and simplification in the development of plugins with easy API and creating templates .

There are too many CMS online, but all provide publication of content and file management, easy Swifost wants to evolve the development of plugins with few lines of code.

### Open source

Because we love the web, our generation loves to create open source systems, that will make the web evolve faster. That's why Swifost is an open source project and it would be interesting for the development of projects in php, and make development easier, for everyone !
